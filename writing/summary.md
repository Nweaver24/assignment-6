### Summary of article (200 words):

Does your phone have potentially bad effects on your mental health? An article on Providence.org suggests that too much time on your cell phone may lead to some adverse effects.
It claims that most studies done show some correlation between cell phones and mental health. It claims that cell phones can affect your sleep schedule and how good of a sleep
you actually get. This being due to the blue light that our screens emit that can mess with our sleep. It then goes on to discuss the possible effects of social media.
Discussing helpful ways to not only step back and take a break from social media and the online world, but also how to make your time online better. Such as limiting who you
follow on social media, giving yourself a set amount of time to be on it, and using apps and websites that are helpful. Only following and staying connected with people or
sources that promote positivity will make your overall time online better. Limiting yourself to a certain amount of time on your phone can help you make healthier choices and be
less involved with your device. Lastly, using apps that help you, with relaxing or staying connected with family or for entertainment, can allow you to be online but not risk
the bad effects that may come with it otherwise.
